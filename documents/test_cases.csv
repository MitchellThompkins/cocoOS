test_case_id,description
TASK-1,On calls to task_create passing it bad data will cause os_assert to be triggered.
TASK-2,tasks cannot be created while the schedule is running.
TASK-3,"when a new task is created, it is added to the list of tasks, that the task is put into an initialization state, and that the function returns the newly assigned taskId."
TASK-4,"when a new task is created, and a message pool size has been assigned to it, the message queue is allocated."
TASK-5,"when a new task is created, the wait queue is cleared."
TASK-6,os_task_init clears and re-initializes the task list.
TASK-7,killing a task causes its state to be set to KILLED.
TASK-8,task_get_data returns a pointer to the task data.
TASK-9,os_task_highest_prio_ready_task will return the task with the highest priority that is ready to run if priority based scheduling is desired
TASK-10,os_task_next_ready_task will return the next task which is ready to run if round robin scheduling is desired
TASK-11,"os_task_release_waiting_task will return the task which has the highest priority and is waiting for a semaphore, and makes it ready to run"
TASK-12,os_task_waiting_this_semaphore will return whether any task is waiting for the specified semaphore
TASK-13,task_wait_sem_set sets the specified task to the wait state and assigns it a specific semaphore for which to wait. It additionally sets the time waited thus for for the semaphore to 0.
TASK-14,task_ready_set sets the specified task to the ready state
TASK-15,"os_task_suspend sets the specified task to the suspended state if it is neither in the KILLED nor SUSPENDED states. Additionally if the task was waiting for a semaphore, then it sets the saved state to READY and internal state to 0; otherwise it sets the saved state to the current state."
TASK-16,os_task_resume sets the specified task into the previously saved state iff the current state is suspended.
TASK-17,task_killed_set sets the specified task into the killed state
TASK-18,os_task_prio_get returns the specified tasks priority
TASK-19,os_task_clear_wait_queue will clear the event wait queue of all tasks
TASK-20,"os_task_wait_time_set sets the specified task to have the specified clockId and time, as well as sets the state to WAITING_TIME"
TASK-21,os_task_wait_event sets the specified event for the specified task TBD
TASK-22,cocoOS shall provide a function to increment the time for all tasks whose state is waiting on a semaphore
TASK-23,TBD cocoOS osticktask msgqueue 
TASK-24,TBD cocoOS osticktask eventqueue 
TASK-23,os_task_signal_event TBD
